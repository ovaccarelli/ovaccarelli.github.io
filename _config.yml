# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: <p>I am Ornella Vaccarelli, a post-doc in the<a href='https://www.tcpunilu.com/'>TCP group</a>at the University of Luxembourg. <br>
              <br>
              My current main research activity focuses on the study of the structures and physical properties of various materials, from the micro to the macroscale level.
              In particular, I am interested in investigating quantum many-body systems through a combined theoretical and numerical approaches in order to predict 
              the collective properties of very large numbers of electrons, atoms or molecules, and discover new principles and phenomena at the multidisciplinary 
              interfaces of physics, chemistry and biology. <br>
              <br>
              I consider myself an ambitious and creative researcher with natural ability for critical thinking and complex problems solving.
              As a curiosity-driven, enthusiast learner and skilled theoretical physicist, I am always motivated by new challenges, 
              prompted to find clever solutions to multidisciplinar problems. <br>

              The combination of mathematical, computer science and physics skill obtained during the diffent and 
              proficuous years of studying and working in research have allowed me to acquire additional persistence 
              to my own ambition and motivation to perform excellent work, and to develop a wide variety of interests, 
              also beyond my area of expertise. Moreover, I earned significant experience 
              in scientific writing on high-impact-factor journals and in public speech at international conferences.
              Thanks to my communication and team-working skills, I established fruitful collaborations, whilst working in various 
              experimentally, computationally, and theoretically oriented multi-national groups. </p>
